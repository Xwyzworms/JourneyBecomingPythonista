now going to g*** you two m*** example problems of computing.eigendecomposition of matrices by hand.Obviously t*** is on the computer but I encourage you to do these problems by h*** and they're not donein Matlab.So I guess that's w*** it means by hand.So let's get started.Here is a two by two matrix and you should pause the video go through f*** the eigenvalues and the eigenvectorsof t*** matrix so the way we start is by shifting the matrix by Lambda so subtracting lambda f*** thediagonal elements setting the determinant equal to z*** and t*** proceeding to compute the determinantwhich is a*** called the characteristic equation of t*** matrix.So t*** works out to be three minus lambda times six minus lambda minus f*** equals z*** and t*** expandingthese two terms multiplying out these two terms and t*** collecting the l*** terms gives us lambda squaredminus n*** lambda p*** fourteen equals z*** and t*** t*** expression h*** can be factored i*** lambdaminus seven and Lambda minus two and now it's pretty e*** to see t*** the two lambdas t*** w*** solvethis equation t*** solve t*** equation.In other words the two eigenvalues of t*** matrix are p*** 7 and p*** two.So t*** was s*** one we found the eigenvalues of t*** matrix and now we go through for e*** of theseeigenvalues shift the matrix by t*** amount by t*** value and t*** figure out w*** is a vector in theshifted matrices n*** space.OK so let's start w*** 2.So t*** gives us the matrix 1 1 4 4.And now we w*** to f*** the missing vector h*** and you've probably guessed it already it is 1 minus1.And of course you k*** t*** a*** acceptable would be minus 1 1 or minus quadrillion p*** quadrillion.This vector simply identifies a subspace for the n*** space of t*** shifted matrix in any vector that'sin t*** n*** space is perfectly f*** as an eigenvector.Now t*** s*** the b*** choice for an eigenvector would be a vector t*** has a n*** of 1 a magnitudeof 1.And the second b*** choice would be integer values t*** are e*** to interpret and compact to write likethis.All right.So t*** was for two.Now we go to the second eigenvalues which was seven and t*** gives us t*** matrix minus 4 1 and 4 minus1.And h*** a vector t*** could w*** as an eigenvector as a basis for the n*** space of t*** shifted matrixis the numbers 1 4.So h*** is the big picture overview we h*** t*** matrix and h*** you see the eigenvalue and its correspondingeigenvector and the other eigenvalue and the other corresponding eigenvector.Now y*** results w*** be correct.If you h*** the correct pairing of eigenvalue and any multiple any scaled version of t*** vector; itdoesn't matter if you c*** t*** lambda one and t*** V one that's f*** because there's no intrinsic ordering.What matters is t*** you h*** the pairing correct.All right.So t*** was the two by two case.Now let's go for a three by three case.This one is a little bit m*** challenging and I h*** to admit.So I first c*** up w*** these numbers and t*** I started computing the eigendecomposition.Now I h*** to admit t*** I got stuck on one of the eigenvectors.I couldn't quite figure it out on my own.So I u*** Matlab to compute thateigenvector.So w*** I encourage you to do is f*** all three eigenvalues by h*** and I think it w*** be pretty obviouswhen you start working through it which is the difficult eigenvalue.So t*** w*** you should do by h*** is f*** two of the eigenvectors t*** you can get basically j*** bykind of eyeballing and making s*** educated guesses.And t*** the third eigenvector you can use a computer to solve or you can j*** w*** and watch me comeup w*** a solution.All right.So again we start by shifting t*** matrix by minus lambda setting the determinant equal to z*** andthen proceeding to compute the determinant of t*** equation and altogether t*** gives us the characteristicequation of t*** matrix.Now t*** is a little bit longer.It's a little bit trickier the arithmetic g*** a little bit hairy in particular you end up w*** thisminus lambda cubed t*** as w*** as a couple of multiple terms w*** Lambda and Lambda squared.Now o*** you collect all of these l*** terms you'll end up w*** an expression t*** looks l*** this.So it should be minus lambda cubed p*** 10 times lambda squared p*** eleven lambda equals z*** Now somethinginteresting has happened h*** all of these terms h*** a lambda attached to t*** which means t*** wecan t*** a lambda out of e*** of these terms and rewrite t*** expression as minus lambda times.All of t*** stuff and immediately t*** tells us t*** lambda equals z*** is a solution.So w*** you set t*** lambda to be z*** it doesn't actually matter what's inside t*** parenthetical statementthat's immediately going to set to m*** t*** equation true.That means t*** one of the eigenvalues of t*** matrix is z*** and I'm going to h*** an entire videojust about t*** phenomenon a little bit later in t*** section.But essentially w*** an eigenvector is an eigenvalue is zero.It means t*** the matrix is singular and t*** you can actually see by looking at t*** matrix and yousee t*** column 1 p*** column 2 equals column 3 so whenever you h*** a singular matrix at least oneeigenvalues value is going to be equal to zero.And in f*** the number of eigenvalues t*** are equal to z*** tells you about the r*** of t*** matrix.More on t*** in the later video.Now o*** you've gotten to t*** s*** you can further factor t*** equation and you end up w*** the resultthat lambda equals z*** lambda equals minus 1 and Lambda equals eleven.So you can probably guess t*** t*** is going to be the tricky I can value to compute the correspondingI can vector of and t*** is the one t*** I got a little bit stuck with.And so I u*** Matlab as a crutch.I cheated a little bit.OK so but let's go through all of these.So we start w*** z*** and now t*** is k*** of a funny thing because we are shifting the matrix by zerowhich actually means we're not changing the matrix at all.And t*** means t*** t*** matrix A already has a non-trivial n*** space e*** without doing any shifting.So t*** problem actually boils d*** to finding a vector in the n*** space or a basis for the n*** space.Even without doing any shifting so based on w*** I j*** t*** you about how do I set up t*** matrix thatcolumn one p*** column two equals column three a basis for the n*** space is 1 one minus 1.So you can try for e*** of these r*** the first column p*** the second column minus the third columnequals z*** all right.So now let's m*** on.So now we shift t*** matrix by eleven and t*** is basically where I got stuck and switch to matlab.So it turns out t*** eigenvector is nineteen forty one and thirty six.So if you figured out t*** I can vector on y*** own without using a computer t*** g*** for you you a*** better or at least m*** patient mathematician t*** I am.And t*** we get to the third eigenvalue which was minus one.So now t*** becomes p*** one.And h*** is t*** shifted matrix and t*** one you should be a*** to solve on y*** own.In f*** it's e*** easier t*** it looks.And if you n*** a h*** before I s*** the answer t*** the h*** is j*** consider t*** t*** third columnis actually pretty useless if you get rid of t*** third column it becomes really e*** to f*** the eigenvector in t*** shifted matrices n*** space.So in f*** it's one minus one and t*** z*** you j*** set the third element to be zero.So t*** leads us to the big picture overview of the eigendecomposition of t*** three by three singularmatrix r*** 2 matrix we h*** eigenvalues 0 minus 11 and minus 1.And these are the corresponding eigenvectors.And notice I've written t*** as row vectors and t*** transpose.So these are still column vectors we generally always think about eigenvectors as column vectors andyou w*** learn m*** about why t*** is the c*** in the video on diagonalization, which is coming up s***
